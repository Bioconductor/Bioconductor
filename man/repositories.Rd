\title{Display current Bioconductor and CRAN repositories.}
\usage{
repositories(site_repository = character(), version = BiocManager::version())
}
\arguments{
\item{site_repository}{(Optional) \code{character(1)} representing an
additional repository (e.g., a URL to an organization's
internally maintained repository) in which to look for packages
to install. This repository will be prepended to the default
repositories returned by the function.}

\item{version}{(Optional) \code{character(1)} or \code{package_version}
indicating the \emph{Bioconductor} version (e.g., "3.8") for which
repositories are required.}
}
\value{
Named \code{character()} of repositories.
}
\description{
\code{repositories()} reports the URLs from which to install
\emph{Bioconductor} and CRAN packages. It is used by
\code{BiocManager::install()} and other functions.
}
\details{
\emph{Bioconductor} has a 'release' and a 'devel' semi-annual release
cycle. Packages within a release have been tested against each
other and the current version of packages on CRAN. \emph{Bioconductor}
best practice is to use packages from the same release, and from
the appropriate CRAN repository. \code{repositories()} returns the
appropriate package repositories for your version of
\emph{Bioconductor}.

It may be desirable to specify different default repositories,
especially CRAN, for intentionally out-of-date \emph{Bioconductor}
releases (e.g., to support reproducible research). We've
implemented an approach to specify alternative repositories
such as MRAN repositories, i.e., \code{options(repos = c(CRAN = "https://mran.microsoft.com/snapshot/2020-02-08"))}.
We recommend and provide the appropriate snapshot date that
coincides with the date of the last Bioconductor build date
for that particular out of date version of Bioconductor.
A caching mechanism prompts the user and saves the response
to opt-in or out of using an MRAN repository when the
Bioconductor and/or R version are out-of-date. The response,
along with the Bioconductor version and R version, is saved
for seven days under the user's home directory at
\code{normalizePath("~/.cache/R/BiocManager/cache_warn.rda")}.

If other alternative default repositories are known to provide
appropriate versions of CRAN or \emph{Bioconductor} packages, the
warning may be silenced (displayed as a message) with
\code{options(BiocManager.check_repositories = FALSE)}. A message is
still printed, to serve as a reminder when debugging problems
related to incompatible package installation.

The intended use of \verb{site_repository =} is to enable installation of
packages not available in the default repositories, e.g., packages
internal to an organization and not yet publicly available. A
secondary use might provide alternative versions (e.g., compiled
binaries) of packages available in the default repositories. Note
that \emph{R}'s standard rules of package selection apply, so the most
recent version of candidate packages is selected independent of the
location of the repository in the vector returned by \code{repositories()}.

For greater flexiblity in installing packages while still adhering
as much as possible to \emph{Bioconductor} best practices, use
\code{repositories()} as a basis for constructing the \verb{repos =} argument
to \code{install.packages()} and related functions.
